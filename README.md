Pandas cookbook
===============

[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for doing
data analysis. It's really fast and lets you do exploratory work
incredibly quickly.

The goal of this cookbook is to give you some concrete examples for
getting started with pandas. The [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
are really comprehensive. However, I've often had people
tell me that they have some trouble getting started, so these are
examples with real-world data, and all the bugs and weirdness
that entails.


* How many people were on Montr√©al's bike paths in 2012
* Montreal's weather for 2012, hourly

It comes with batteries (data) included, so you can try out all the
examples right away.
